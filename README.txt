Web development projects
Greetings to you! Welcome to my repository for my web development portfolio. Listed below is a detailed record of projects that I have done while learning web development. Each commit is listed with a date for the commit, the name of the files commited, and a description of the content of the files. At the end of this document is a list of links to additional projects that I have done that are stored elsewhere here on Github.

First commit:
  Date of commit:
    9/24/20
  Files committed:
    tribute.html
    tribute-main.css
  Description:
    This project is part of Freecodecamp's responsive web design course and it required the duplication of a tribute page for a Dr. Norman Borlaug. The my solution for this project can be viewed on my codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/eYZxMew. My solution for this project implemented Bootstrap 4 via the Bootstrap 4 CDN (though this is not visible within the code displayed on my codepen, with the head of the page implementing the Bootstrap 4 card component. In adddition to implementing Bootstrap 4, I also made additional modifications of my own which can be viewed within the file titled tribute-main.css.
     
Second commit:
  Date of commit:
    11/4/20
  Files committed:
    udemy-bootstrap_bootcamp_forms_practice.html
    udemy_bootstrap_bootcamp_forms_exercise_solution.html
  Description:
    Both of these html files are part of the 6th section of a Bootstrap 4 bootcamp on Udemy which can be viewed here: https://www.udemy.com/share/101WZyAEAbdlZRQ3kF/
    Both of these documents implement Bootstrap 4 via the Bootstrap 4 CDN. The first of these two files, the -forms_practice.html file, contains pretty plain html and it is just there to demonstrate the basic code needed to put together an html form using Bootstrap 4. The second file, -froms_exercise_solution.html, contains my solution for the final exercise assigned in this forms module in this couse. For this exercise, two images were provided and the goal was to recreate the html forms displayed within those images using Bootstrap 4. This assignment was split up into two parts, each corresponding to one of the two images, and that is why the form itself contains headings with the text "Part 1" and "Part 2" respectively.The second file may be viewed on my codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/pobZRWQ

Third commit:
  Date of commit:
    11/5/20
  Files committed:
    survey_form.html
    custom.css
    upstate_highway.jpg
  Description:
    This is my solution for FreeCodeCamp's survey form project which is part of their responsive web design course. A version of this project can be viewed on my codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/ExypXaJ. The main difference between the version uploaded here and the version that is on my codepen is the backgound image. The image stored here is an image that I took personally and it has been included with the rest of the documents that make up this small project. This project implements Bootstrap 4 via the Bootstrap 4 CDN and it makes liberal use of Bootstrap classes.

Fourth commit:
  Date of commit:
    11/5/20
  Files committed:
    udemy_nav_navbar_exercise_solution
  Description:
    This is a project that is part of a Bootstrap 4 bootcamp on udemy, viewable here: https://www.udemy.com/share/101WZyAEAbdlZRQ3kF/. This project was based on two provided images, one of an extra-small mobile display while the other was of an image of an extra-large screen, and the requirements were to recreate the webpage modeled in the images, demonstrating responsize nav and navbar design with Bootstrap 4. This project is also viewable on my codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/oNLMVRY
 
Fifth commit:
  Date of commit:
    11/5/20
  Files committed:
    udemy_grid_exercise_solution.html
  Description:
    This is a very simple project demonstrating how to implement Bootstrap 4's grid system and implement responsiveness at the same time. This short, simple assignment was part of a udemy Bootstrap 4 bootcamp viewable here: https://www.udemy.com/share/101WZyAEAbdlZRQ3kF/

Sixth commit:
  Date of commit:
    11/6/20
  Files committed:
    dasmotos_arts_and_crafts
  Description:
    This short project was included as part of the capstone for Codecademyâ€™s lesson on local web design in the web design path. The goal of the project was to use an editor (sublime, atom, or Visual Code Studio) to create a simple webpage according to provided specs. The assignment was not guided, meaning I was not told specifically how to write the html or the css code for the project. The only guidance provided was in regards to how the styling should be done (provided in the spec document). This was a simple, static web page. 

Seventh commit:
  Date of commit:
    11/10/20
  Files committed:
    Technical Documentation page
  Description:
    This project is my solution for Freecodecamp's technical documentation project, a capstone project for their responsive web design course. This version of my project does not include the auto grader from FCC. This project can be viewed on my codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/PozxERO, as well as the version with the auto grader at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/PozxEbm. The project is built with the bootstrap 4 framework and it features a bootstrap 4 scrollspy as well as two very different formats and positions for the page's navigation based on the size of the screen being used to view the page. The content of the page is just lorem ipsum text, making this project a template for a documentation page. I gave the project a grey-scale color scheme to give the project a utilitarian feel.

Eigth commit:
  Date of commit:
    11/13/20
  Files commiteed:
    Aurora Grove
    Aurora icons
    Aurora gallery
    Aurora grove screenshots
  Description:
    This is the largest project in my portfolio to date. This project was the capstone for a bootstrap bootcamp on Udemy viewable at: https://www.udemy.com/share/101WZyAEAbdlZRQ3kF/ . The project incorporated a siginficant number of bootstrap components and utilities to create a responsive, semi-interactive webpage for a hotal/camping experience. The project featured downloading the Bootstrap 4 source files and modifying them locally using SCSS. The project also included a number of instructor provided images that unfortunately I am not able to upload to this repository given their rather large size (they are too large for my extremely slow internet connection to handle). The images are supposed to be stored in a file called images in the following structure:
    	images (directory)
		gallery	(directory)
			social1.png
			social2.png
			social3.png
			social4.png
			social5.png
			social6.png
			social7.png
			social8.png
		icons	(directory)
			campfire.png
			nature.png
			tent.png
		slider (directory)
    			caribou.png
			coffee.png
			fire.png
			trees.png
		dogs.png
		main.jpeg
		winter.png
However, the slider images and the three images at the bottom (dogs, main, and winter) are too large to upload, so they are absent from this commit. A version of this project can be viewed on my codepen, but all of the proper images are missing there. The following is the link to this project on my codepen: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/MWeLJpe . In order to make this project function, you need to download the original bootstrap source files and extract the downloaded files from the zip folder that they will be packaged in. Then the extracted files should be placed directly into the project's main directory without any further modifications made to them. Included in this commit is a file containing screenshots of the completed project (aurora grove screenshots), these screenshots show the index.html file displayed on a md/lg screen size. Not displayed are the mobile views, along with the modal that is hidden by defualt, but displyed on the screen whenever one of the "book" buttons are clicked, as well as the collasped navbar.

  Files committed:
    looplab_social_theme
  Description:
    This project is one of five from a Udemy course on Bootstrap 4, viewable here: https://www.udemy.com/share/101Xd8AEAbdlZRQ3kF/
This project is a basic social theme, for say a social media website. It implements Bootstrap 4 as well as the full version of jQuery (instead of the slim version that is included with the stock bootstrap boiler plate). This project is notable for the implementation of smooth scrolling, allowing you to click on any of the nav links resulting in the page automatically scrolling to the section of the page that corresponds with the id used in the nav link. This is made possible with the full jQuery library and it will not function with the slim version used in the stock bootstrap boiler plate. A modal is also implemented in this project so that if you click on the 'contact us' button located in the footer, a modal containing a form will pop up. This project can also be viewed on my Codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/yLJmBbb

Twentieth commit:

  Description:
  			FCC Portfolio Page
      This is a simple, grey scale portfolio page based on a model provided by FreeCodeCamp viewable here: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG
This project is part of FreeCodeCamp's responsive web design course. The color scheme is grey-scale, like several of my other projects, because I personally like the appearance of a grey-scale color scheme. This project implements Bootstrap 4 and Font Awsome via CDNs. This project can be viewed on my Codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/eYzaYNa
  			FCC Product Landing Page
      This is the product landing page project for FCC's responsive web design course. This project is based on the model provided by FCC, viewable here: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL 
This is my own take on the project, which implements bootstrap 4, font awesome, and google fonts. This project can be viewed on my Codepen at:https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/OJXqVPg

Twentyfirst commit:
  Date of commit:
    11/22/20
  Files committed:
    udemy_portfolio_page
  Description:
    This is a model portfolio built with bootstrap 4. Instead of the portfolio being built with multiple HTML documents linked together, this portfolio is a single, large HTML document wherein an accordian is implemented using Bootstrap 4 collapse classes. Additionally, Ekko Lightbox is implemented as well, allowing for a better image viewing experience for the user when browsing the project images in the work tab. This portfolio page was built as the final project for a udemy bootstrap 4 course viewable here: https://www.udemy.com/share/101Xd8AEAbdlZRQ3kF/ 
    This project may be viewed on my Codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/YzWMMVR

    udemy_blogen_admin_ui
  Description:
    This project is part of a set of five projects from a udemy course on Bootstrap 4 by Brad Traversy, viewable here: https://www.udemy.com/share/101Xd8AEAbdlZRQ3kF/ This project is built with the vanilla Bootstrap 4 framework, while also implementing font awesome icons and the CKEditor in several of the modals. I've modified the project, adding several pages that were not included by Brad Traversy in his course. In total, this project is composed of 10 html pages and it is completely responsive. This project can be viewed on my codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/project/editor/ZnGjOy

Twentythird commit:
  Date of commit:
    11/25/2020
  Files committed:
    glozzom_theme
  Description:
    Glozzom is a 5-page theme for an online company offering subscription based services, combined with a blog as well. This theme is one of five projects included in Brad Traversy's Bootstrap 4 course, available on udemy at: https://www.udemy.com/share/101Xd8AEAbdlZRQ3kF/ This project implements a lot of JavaScript and CSS libraries in addition to the Bootstrap framework, most notably the Slick slider implemented in about.html. The full jQuery library is implemented as well as opposed to the slim version included in the standard Bootstrap boilerplate. Another notable feature is the video embedded in the modal on index.html. This project can be viewed on my Codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/project/editor/XEwpQq

Twentyfourth commit:
  Date of commit:
    11/26/2020
  Files committed:
    Mizuxie
  Description:
    Mizuxie is one of five projects included in Brad Traversy's Bootstrap 4 course, viewable here:https://www.udemy.com/share/101XpeAEAbdlZRQ3kF/ 
The original title of the project was Mizuxe; however, I modified the name slightly to be more like a language that I recognize. The spelling of the original name was soo close to the spelling of a three-syllable name in standard Chinese, that I simply added an extra 'i' at the end so that the name would conform with Pinyin spelling conventions. This is a single page project that features a customized bootstrap framework, modified with sass. This one-page theme is for a book, published by the fictional Mizuxie. In regards to how the page is put together, the implementation of smooth scrolling is notable. This project is the second project that I have done where I have used SCSS inorder to put together the CSS styles for a page. This project can be viewed on my Codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/RwGwwOa
