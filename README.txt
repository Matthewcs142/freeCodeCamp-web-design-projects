Web development projects
Greetings to you! Welcome to my repository for my web development portfolio. Listed below is a detailed record of projects that I have done while learning web development. Each commit is listed with a date for the commit, the name of the files commited, and a description of the content of the files. At the end of this document is a list of links to additional projects that I have done that are stored elsewhere here on Github.

First commit:
  Date of commit:
    9/24/20
  Files committed:
    tribute.html
    tribute-main.css
  Description:
    This project is part of Freecodecamp's responsvie web design course and it required the duplication of a tribute page for a Dr. Norman Borlaug. The my solution for this project can be viewed on my codepen at: https://codepen.io/matthewcs142/pen/eYZxMew. My solution for this project implemented Bootstrap 4 via the Bootstrap 4 CDN (though this is not visible within the code displayed on my codepen, with the head of the page implementing the Bootstrap 4 card component. In adddition to implementing Bootstrap 4, I also made additional modifications of my own which can be viewed within the file titled tribute-main.css.
     
Second commit:
  Date of commit:
    11/4/20
  Files committed:
    udemy-bootstrap_bootcamp_forms_practice.html
    udemy_bootstrap_bootcamp_forms_exercise_solution.html
  Description:
    Both of these html files are part of the 6th section of a Bootstrap 4 bootcamp on Udemy which can be viewed here: https://www.udemy.com/share/101WZyAEAbdlZRQ3kF/
    Both of these documents implement Bootstrap 4 via the Bootstrap 4 CDN. The first of these two files, the -forms_practice.html file, contains pretty plain html and it is just there to demonstrate the basic code needed to put together an html form using Bootstrap 4. The second file, -froms_exercise_solution.html, contains my solution for the final exercise assigned in this forms module in this couse. For this exercise, two images were provided and the goal was to recreate the html forms displayed within those images using Bootstrap 4. This assignment was split up into two parts, each corresponding to one of the two images, and that is why the form itself contains headings with the text "Part 1" and "Part 2" respectively.
